# 🎤 VoiceBreaker 🔓

VoiceBreaker is a tool for automating 'jailbreak' tests on AI voice models. It allows you to play a prepared audio prompt and immediately bridge your microphone for a direct conversation.

## How It Works

The process is simple and automated:

1. **Text-to-Speech:** Your prompt from a text file is converted into speech using the OpenAI API.
2. **Prompt Playback:** The generated audio is played on a virtual audio device, which your target AI model should be listening to.
3. **Microphone Bridge:** After playback is complete, the program automatically forwards the audio from your real microphone to the virtual device. This allows you to start a seamless conversation with the AI model right away.

## Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* [VB-CABLE Virtual Audio Device](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) (or another virtual audio cable)
* An OpenAI API Key

> ⚠️ **VoiceBreaker currently works only on Windows.**
> Support for macOS and Linux is planned for the future.

## Installation and Configuration

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TLBC-pl/VoiceBreaker.git
cd voicebreaker
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Install VB-CABLE:** Download and install the virtual audio cable from the [developer's website](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/).

3. **Set up the `.env` file:**
   After cloning, you will find a file named `.env.example` in the project root.
   **Rename this file to `.env`** and open it in your text editor.
   Set your OpenAI API key as shown below:

   ```env
   # .env file
   OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
   ```

4. **Configure the Target Application:**
   In the settings of the AI bot or application you are testing, **set its audio input (microphone) to `CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)`**. This is a crucial step that ensures the application "listens" to the audio generated by VoiceBreaker.

## Usage

Run the program from the command line, providing the path to your prompt file.

```bash
python main.py --prompt-file path/to/prompt.txt
```
